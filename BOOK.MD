## Introduction

Ethical hacking plays a critical role in cybersecurity by helping organizations identify and fix vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors. This guide covers three core areas of ethical hacking, each designed to help you understand and practice the foundational skills in a safe and controlled manner.

This guide is organized by modules, which cover:
- **Network Security Basics**: Learn to understand and analyze network traffic, scanning techniques, and port monitoring.
- **Web Application Security**: Discover common web vulnerabilities, like SQL injection, and learn to protect applications against them.
- **Cryptography Basics**: Explore the essentials of data encryption and hashing, and practice cracking hashed passwords to understand vulnerabilities.

#### Topics Covered

- **Port Scanning**: Identifying open ports on a networked device.
- **Network Protocols**: Overview of common protocols like TCP/IP.
- **Traffic Analysis**: Using basic tools to analyze incoming and outgoing traffic.

#### Exercise Example

**Objective**: Simulate a port scan to identify open ports on a network.

1. **Start the Module**:
   ```python
   network_security_module()
   ```
2. **Scan Result**:
   ```plaintext
   Scanning port 22... Open
   Scanning port 80... Open
   Scanning port 443... Open
   ```

#### Topics Covered

- **SQL Injection**: Exploiting SQL databases by injecting malicious queries.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injecting malicious scripts into websites.
- **Basic Defense Mechanisms**: Sanitizing inputs, using prepared statements, and other security practices.

#### Exercise Example

**Objective**: Simulate an SQL injection by using a simple SQL query.

1. **Start the Module**:
   ```python
   web_application_security_module()
   ```
2. **Injection Input Example**:
   ```plaintext
   Input: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=' ' OR '1'='1';
   ```
3. **Expected Result**:
   ```plaintext
   Access Granted! You've simulated a SQL injection vulnerability.
   ```

#### Topics Covered

- **Hashing Functions**: Understanding hashing algorithms like MD5, SHA-1.
- **Encryption Basics**: Overview of encryption techniques.
- **Hash Cracking**: Experiment with cracking a hashed password to learn about brute-forcing and dictionary attacks.

#### Exercise Example

**Objective**: Crack a given hash (MD5) to retrieve the original password.

1. **Start the Module**:
   ```python
   cryptography_basics_module()
   ```
2. **Hash Example**:
   ```plaintext
   Given Hash: 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
   ```
3. **Expected Password**:
   ```plaintext
   Password cracked! The original password is 'password'.
   ```

## Simulator Exercises

Each module includes a practical, hands-on exercise designed to enhance understanding through application. Users are encouraged to:

- **Experiment** with different inputs.
- **Analyze Outputs** to learn how each action impacts system behavior.
- **Reflect on Security Implications** to understand the importance of ethical hacking.

The following is a sample execution flow using the **Ethical Hacking Code Simulator**:

```bash
python simulator.py
```

You will be prompted to select a module. Each module guides you through specific tasks with simple hints for successful completion.
